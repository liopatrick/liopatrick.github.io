        <h3>Before</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Audit and Document All Connected Devices:
                <ul>
                    <li>Regularly update an inventory of all devices connected to the network, including workstations, servers, and mobile devices.</li>
                    <li>Implement a configuration management database (CMDB) to track device details such as operating system, software installed, network connections, and security configurations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Follow IT business’ best practices / plan
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement strong data backup and encryption practices.</li>
                    <li>Ensure antivirus and antimalware solutions are up to date.</li>
                    <li>Establish Network Segmentation:</li>

                            <li>Design and enforce network segmentation policies to limit how devices communicate across the network, thereby reducing the spread of ransomware.</li>
                            <li>Create secure zones in the network that segregate critical devices and information from general user access areas.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>During</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Communicate the incident to all resources in this incident response plan.
                <ul>
                    <li>IR plan participants act on their assigned roles.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Determine which devices are compromised and document specifics such as IP address, device type, user, and observed symptoms of the ransomware.</li>
                    <li>Use network monitoring tools to visualize network traffic and pinpoint other devices that may be communicating with the infected system.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Isolate Infected Devices:
                <ul>
                    <li>Immediately disconnect affected devices from all network connections, both wired and wireless, to prevent the ransomware from spreading to other network segments.</li>
                    <li>Implement quarantines or blocklists on network equipment to restrict traffic to and potentially impacted devices.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Identify the start of the infection (patient zero) in order to benchmark recovery efforts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>After</h3>
        <ul>
